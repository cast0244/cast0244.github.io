                            Hi there, I'm Daniel.  I'm currently a student enrolled in Algonquin College's <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program. I've also done Graphic Design as a freelancer for a handful of years now. I'm interested in expanding my abilities, which is why I decided to enter the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD</abbr> program. I've done some amateur work in most of the topics that <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD</abbr> cover, but in order to pick something and be more serious about it I'm now studying all of it to see what I enjoy most.

                            <div>
                            I help organize local <strong>esports events</strong> here in Ottawa. I've been part of the organization team for the last <em>3 years</em>. I've learned a lot about planning events, working with teams and helping patrons. I've also learned a lot about the technical side of things such as streaming events and setting up things like the stage, microphones, cameras and more. Some of my responsabilities include:

                                <li>Set up and tear down</li>
                                <li>Set up and running the stream for the events</li>
                                <li>Making graphics (logos, overlays) or videos (trailers, highlights) for events</li>
                                <li>Commentating when needed</li>
                                <li>Posting announcements and reminders</li>
                                <li>Running the bracket when needed</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And some of my hobbies are:</p>

                                    <li>Gamedev. I've only made one simple full game before, but I enjoy the process of putting it together and hope to expand my boundaries soon.</li>
                                    <li>Editing Videos</li>
                                </ul>

                            </div>
                        <p>
                            I also compete in these events myself, and have even come 1<sup>st</sup> a few times. Though as of right now, the events are postponed due to lockdown orders.
